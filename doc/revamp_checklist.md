### 2. **The Problem (and Scale)**

* **Headline**:
  *“AI Compute is the Bottleneck”*
* **Content**:

  * Cost to train GPT-4: \$50M+, months of runtime.
  * 500MW data center burn for AI workloads.
  * Stagnant chip progress vs. model growth.
* **Visual**:

  * Use `market_cap.svg` here with accompanying callouts (e.g. \$1T AI software market, \$360B silicon).
  * Simple overlay or scroll-activated annotations.
* **Design**:

  * Minimalist text with floating stat blocks.
  * Light background, clean section breaks.

---

### 3. **The Breakthrough**

* **Headline**:
  *“Pure Integer Training: A World First”*
* **Content**:

  * Transformer trained with 0 FP ops.
  * 3.8× MAC advantage (Speed, Power, Area).
  * Enables radically simpler chips.
* **Visual**:

  * Animated comparison: FP32 vs Integer.
  * Highlight simplified MAC diagram or RTL block if available.

---

### 4. **How It Works (at a Glance)**

* **Headline**:
  *“How We Replace Floating Point”*
* **Content**:

  * Custom number encoding.
  * Integer-only matmul, softmax, layernorm, optimizer.
  * Training + inference validated on Pythia.
* **Visual**:

  * Interactive diagram or layered stack.
  * Use existing `layer-stack` UI or highlight flow from model → encoding → silicon.

---

### 5. **Market Timing & Why Now**

* **Headline**:
  *“The Moment is Right”*
* **Content**:

  * Models are growing faster than hardware.
  * Energy crisis + data center capex pressure.
  * Exploding demand for on-device / edge inference.
* **Visual**:

  * Timeline with chips, models, power trendlines.
  * Highlight “this tech wasn’t possible before” narrative.

---

### 6. **Real-World Impact**

* **Headline**:
  *“What 10× Really Means”*
* **Content**:

  * \$295M/year savings at 1GW datacenter.
  * HAL9000-level edge AI.
  * Autonomous cars that self-learn.
* **Visual**:

  * Cards or tiles showing each use case (use from real-possibilities section).
  * Subtle animation or hover states.

---

### 7. **Business Model & Go-To-Market**

* **Headline**:
  *“Licensing First. Chips Next.”*
* **Content**:

  * Phase 1: License RTL IP (MAC, encoder, training ops).
  * Phase 2: Vertical integration into full accelerator card.
  * Open source components (OpenLane, Yosys) de-risk fabrication.
* **Visual**:

  * Roadmap with phases.
  * IP blocks shown like modular puzzle pieces.

### 8. **Why Me / Why This Team**

* **Headline**:
  *“Built By a Silicon-Level Technologist”*
* **Content**:

  * Your background: EE + CS + AI + entrepreneurship.
  * Patent. BBS. SendThisFile. Investment. Research.
  * Solo founder for now; seeking elite cofounder.
* **Visual**:

  * Clean bio image + highlights.
  * Optionally scroll-reveal deeper credentials.

---

### 9. **Call to Action / Get in Touch**

* **Headline**:
  *“Let’s Build the Future of AI Compute”*
* **Content**:

  * Email.
  * LinkedIn, GitHub.
  * Invite for collaborators, advisors, investors.
* **Visual**:

  * Footer with soft gradient from brand palette.

---

### 10. **Design Notes**

* Use the `market_cap.svg` colors as your **theme palette**:

  * Teal (#0f9ca5), Indigo, Soft Purple, Warm Yellow.
* Unify with clean, sans-serif typography (you already use Inter).
* Spacing, grid layout, scroll motion (via AOS) should feel smooth and intentional.
* Add subtle glassmorphism and elevation where needed to modernize feel.
